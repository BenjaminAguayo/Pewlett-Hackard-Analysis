## 3. Summary
**- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?**

The number of rolls to be filled is the same as the number of retiring employees, given in **Table 1**. As it is shown, the larges amount of employees is Senior Engineers.

**- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?**

As it is shown in **Table 3** There are not enough mentors to train the next generation. The best ratio (New folks)/(Mentor) per title is for Assistant Engineer with **14 trainees per mentor**, and the worst ratio is for Senior Engineer with **153 tranees per mentor**.
The mentor program is not a valid choice to face teh "silver tsunami"
